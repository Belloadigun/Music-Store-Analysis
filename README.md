# üß†Introduction
This project is a hands-on analytical exploration of a fictional music store database using Structured Query Language (SQL). Through this analysis, we aim to uncover meaningful insights that reflect real-world business scenarios‚Äîranging from customer behavior to sales performance, artist impact, and genre preferences.

The project specifically focuses on answering a set of well-defined business questions:

Who is the most senior employee based on job title?

Which country has the highest number of invoices?

What are the top 3 highest invoice values ever recorded?

Which city has generated the most revenue‚Äîand could therefore host a promotional music festival?

Who is the best customer, based on total money spent?

Who are the Rock music listeners, and what are their names and emails?

Which artists have produced the most Rock tracks, and who are the top 10?

Which tracks have a song length above the average, and how long are they?

By developing targeted SQL queries, this project demonstrates how relational databases can be used to drive business decisions, personalize marketing efforts, and enhance customer experience in a music retail environment.
